	abstract = {It is important for building owners and operators to manage the electrical energy consumption of their buildings. As electrical energy is the major form of energy consumed in a commercial building, the ability to forecast electrical energy consumption in a building will bring great beneﬁts to the building owners and operators. This paper provides a review of the building electrical energy consumption forecasting methods which include the conventional and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods. The signiﬁcant goal of this study is to review, recognize, and analyse the performance of both methods for forecasting of electrical energy consumption. Compared to using a single method of forecasting, the hybrid of two forecasting methods can possibly be applied for more precise results. Regarding this potential, the swarm intelligence (SI) method has been reviewed to be hybridized with AI. Published literature presented in this paper shows that, the hybrid of SVM and SI methods has indeed presented superior performance for forecasting building electrical energy consumption.},

	abstract = {This study presents a methodology to forecast diurnal cooling load energy consumption for institutional buildings using data driven techniques. The cases for three institutional buildings are examined. A detailed analysis on their energy consumption data for two years shows that there is a high variation in diurnal energy consumption. This is largely attributed to the university scheduling and vacation periods. To reduce the degree of variation, the energy consumption data is divided into classes. These class numbers are then taken as inputs for the forecasting model which is developed using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN). The results show that the ANN is able to train and forecast the next day energy use based on ﬁve previous days’ data with good accuracy. The model development, along with ANN architecture used in this case is discussed in detail. As a next step, the forecasted output is taken back as an input with a view to forecast the output of the following day. This step is repeated and the model exhibits an R2 of more than 0.94 in forecasting the energy consumption for the next 20 days. It is also noted that such a methodology can be positively extended to other institutional buildings.},

	abstract = {The methodology to predict building energy consumption is increasingly important for building energy baseline model development and measurement and veriﬁcation protocol (MVP). This paper presents support vector machines (SVM), a new neural network algorithm, to forecast building energy consumption in the tropical region. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility and applicability of SVM in building load forecasting area. Four commercial buildings in Singapore are selected randomly as case studies. Weather data including monthly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T0), relative humidity (RH) and global solar radiation (GSR) are taken as three input features. Mean monthly landlord utility bills are collected for developing and testing models. In addition, the performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, C and e, was explored using stepwise searching method based on radial-basis function (RBF) kernel. Finally, all prediction results are found to have coefﬁcients of variance (CV) less than 3\% and percentage error (\%error) within 4\%.},
