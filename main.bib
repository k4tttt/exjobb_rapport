	abstract = {With the development of smart grid as well as the electricity market, it is of increasing signiﬁcance to predict the household electricity consumption. In this paper, a novel data-driven framework is proposed to predict the annual household electricity consumption using ensemble learning technique. The extreme gradient boosting forest and feedforward deep networks are served as base models. These base models are combined by ridge regression. What is more, the importances of input features are estimated. A subset of features is selected as the important features to feed into the model to increase its accuracy. A comparison of the proposed ensemble framework against classical regression models indicates that the former can reduce by 30\% of the prediction error. The results of this study show that ensemble learning method can be a convenient and accurate approach to predict household electricity consumption.},

	abstract = {This paper presents three ensemble learning models for short term load forecasting. Machine learning has evolved quickly in recent years, leading to novel and advanced models that are improving the forecasting results in multiple ﬁelds. However, in highly dynamic ﬁelds such as power and energy systems, dealing with the fast acquisition of large amounts of data from multiple data sources and taking advantage from the correlation between the multiple available variables is a challenging task, for which current models are not prepared. Ensemble learning is bringing promising results in this sense, as, by combining the results and use of multiple learners, is able to ﬁnd new ways for current learning models to be used and optimized. In this paper three ensemble learning models are developed and the respective results compared: gradient boosted regression trees, random forests and an adaptation of Adaboost. Results for electricity consumption forecasting in hour-ahead are presented using a case-study based on real data from an ofﬁce building. Results show that the adapted Adaboost model outperforms the reference models for hour-ahead load forecasting.},

However, it has been found that the monthly electricity consumption demonstrates a complex nonlinear characteristic and an obvious seasonal tendency. Support vector regression has been widely applied to handle nonlinear time series prediction, but it suffers from the key parameters selection and the inﬂuence of seasonal tendency. This paper proposes a novel approach, which hybridizes support vector regression model with fruit ﬂy optimization algorithm and the seasonal index adjustment to forecast monthly electricity consumption. Besides, in order to comprehensively evaluate the forecasting performance of the hybrid model, a small sample of monthly electricity consumption of China and a large sample of monthly electricity retail sales of the United States were employed to demonstrate the forecasting performance. The results show that the proposed hybrid approach is a viable option for the electricity consumption forecasting applications.},

It introduces a hybrid approach that uses machine learning (ML) to forecast electricity usage in homes, improving accuracy through the extraction of correlated features. The accuracy of predictions is assessed using loss functions and the root mean square error (RMSE). In response to increasing interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), this paper proposes a framework for predicting energy consumption in smart homes. This user-friendly approach helps users understand their energy consumption patterns by employing shapley additive explanations (SHAP) techniques to provide clear explanations. The research uses gradient boosting and long short-term memory neural networks to forecast energy usage. In the context of sustainable urban development, it emphasizes the importance of conserving energy in homes. The paper explores AI and ML methods for predicting residential energy use, aiming to make socially meaningful impacts. It highlights the need to understand the factors affecting predictions to improve the accountability, reliability, and justification of decisions in energy optimization. Explainable AI techniques are used to gain insights into the prediction models and identify factors influencing household energy consumption.

	abstract = {With the rapid development and wide application of distributed generation technology and new energy trading methods, the integrated energy system has developed rapidly in Europe in recent years and has become the focus of new strategic competition and cooperation among countries. As a key technology and decision-making approach for operation, optimization, and control of integrated energy systems, power consumption prediction faces new challenges. The user-side power demand and load characteristics change due to the influence of distributed energy. At the same time, in the open retail market of electricity sales, the forecast of electricity consumption faces the power demand of small-scale users, which is more easily disturbed by random factors than by a traditional load forecast. Therefore, this study proposes a model based on X12 and Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposition of monthly electricity consumption forecasting methods. The first use of the STL model according to the properties of electricity each month is its power consumption time series decomposition individuation. It influences the factorization of monthly electricity consumption into season, trend, and random components. Then, the change in the characteristics of the three components over time is considered. Finally, the appropriate model is selected to predict the components in the reconfiguration of the monthly electricity consumption forecast. A forecasting program is developed based on R language and MATLAB, and a case study is conducted on the power consumption data of a university campus containing distributed energy. Results show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.},

	abstract = {Accurate electricity consumption forecasting in residential buildings has a direct impact on energy efficiency and cost management, making it a critical component of sustainable energy practices. Decision tree-based ensemble learning techniques are particularly effective for this task due to their ability to process complex datasets with high accuracy. Furthermore, incorporating explainable artificial intelligence into these predictions provides clarity and interpretability, allowing energy managers and homeowners to make informed decisions that optimize usage and reduce costs. This study comparatively analyzes decision tree–ensemble learning techniques augmented with explainable artificial intelligence for transparency and interpretability in residential building energy consumption forecasting. This approach employs the University Residential Complex and Appliances Energy Prediction datasets, data preprocessing, and decision-tree bagging and boosting methods. The superior model is evaluated using the Shapley additive explanations method within the explainable artificial intelligence framework, explaining the influence of input variables and decision-making processes. The analysis reveals the significant influence of the temperature-humidity index and wind chill temperature on short-term load forecasting, transcending traditional parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy. Finally, we show the standard approaches that are leveraged to deal with the mentioned challenges.},

Accurate energy forecasting models have numerous implications in planning and energy optimization of buildings and campuses. For new buildings, where past recorded data is unavailable, computer simulation methods are used for energy analysis and forecasting future scenarios. However, for existing buildings with historically recorded time series energy data, statistical and machine learning techniques have proved to be more accurate and quick. This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing machine learning techniques for forecasting time series energy consumption. Although the emphasis is given to a single time series data analysis, the review is not just limited to it since energy data is often co-analyzed with other time series variables like outdoor weather and indoor environmental conditions. The nine most popular forecasting techniques that are based on the machine learning platform are analyzed. An in-depth review and analysis of the ‘hybrid model’, that combines two or more forecasting techniques is also presented. The various combinations of the hybrid model are found to be the most eﬀective in time series energy forecasting for building.},

Therefore, electricity forecasting is a very important task. It allows for better planning and management of energy resources. Several methods have been proposed to forecast energy consumption. In this work, to predict monthly electricity consumption for the economic sector, we develop a novel approach based on ensemble learning. Our approach combines three models that proved successful in the ﬁeld, namely: Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit neural networks, and Temporal Convolutional Networks. The experiments have been conducted with almost 2000 clients and 14 years of monthly electricity consumption from Bejaia, Algeria. The results show that the proposed ensemble models achieve better performance than both the company's requirements and the prediction of the traditional individual models.

	abstract = {This study presents a methodology to forecast diurnal cooling load energy consumption for institutional buildings using data driven techniques. The cases for three institutional buildings are examined. A detailed analysis on their energy consumption data for two years shows that there is a high variation in diurnal energy consumption. This is largely attributed to the university scheduling and vacation periods. To reduce the degree of variation, the energy consumption data is divided into classes. These class numbers are then taken as inputs for the forecasting model which is developed using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN). The results show that the ANN is able to train and forecast the next day energy use based on ﬁve previous days’ data with good accuracy. The model development, along with ANN architecture used in this case is discussed in detail. As a next step, the forecasted output is taken back as an input with a view to forecast the output of the following day. This step is repeated and the model exhibits an R2 of more than 0.94 in forecasting the energy consumption for the next 20 days. It is also noted that such a methodology can be positively extended to other institutional buildings.},

	abstract = {It is important for building owners and operators to manage the electrical energy consumption of their buildings. As electrical energy is the major form of energy consumed in a commercial building, the ability to forecast electrical energy consumption in a building will bring great beneﬁts to the building owners and operators. This paper provides a review of the building electrical energy consumption forecasting methods which include the conventional and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods. The signiﬁcant goal of this study is to review, recognize, and analyse the performance of both methods for forecasting of electrical energy consumption. Compared to using a single method of forecasting, the hybrid of two forecasting methods can possibly be applied for more precise results. Regarding this potential, the swarm intelligence (SI) method has been reviewed to be hybridized with AI. Published literature presented in this paper shows that, the hybrid of SVM and SI methods has indeed presented superior performance for forecasting building electrical energy consumption.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity consumption for residential households where highly irregular human behaviour plays a significant role. The methodology requires data from fiscal smart meters, which makes it applicable to real scenarios where personal data gathering is not feasible. These data are rarely complete; therefore, a robust combination of machine-learning techniques is used to handle missing data and outliers. The novelty of this method relies on identifying and predicting user electricity consumption behaviour as a procedure to improve the forecasting of the overall electricity consumption of each individual customer. The methodology uses Gaussian mixture clustering to identify behaviour clusters and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification (XGBoost) model to predict the day-ahead behaviour pattern. This predicted user behaviour cluster is fed into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to enable an improved capturing of the highly unpredictable user conduct for the forecast of electricity consumption. A novel metric, namely the Euclidean Distance-based Accuracy (EDA), is finally proposed to enable a more thorough evaluation of time series classification algorithms. The whole development is tested over 500 residential users placed in a southeastern region of Spain. The results showed that, when the novel approach was used, the MAPEd and NRMSEd were reduced by 7\% and 9\% respectively, increasing to a 20\% and 17\% respective reduction for the best cases according to EDA. This methodology sets the basis for massive user-centred analyses, very profitable to any electricity company.},

	abstract = {Understanding and changing household energy consumption behavior are considered as effective ways to improve energy efﬁciency and promote energy conservation. With the increasing penetration of conventional and emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) in energy sector, traditional energy systems are being digitized. The energy big data provides a new way to analyze and understand individuals' energy consumption behavior, and thus to improve energy efﬁciency and promote energy conservation. We ﬁrst propose a framework of the interdisciplinary research of energy, social and information science, which includes energy social science, social informatics and energy informatics. Then, different dimensions and different research paradigms of household energy consumption behavior are presented. Household energy consumption behavior can be analyzed in time dimension, user dimension and spatial dimension. The economic paradigm (including demand response) and the behavior-oriented paradigm (including intervention strategies) are two major research streams of household energy consumption behavior. Finally, the “4V” characteristics (i.e., volume, velocity, variety and value) of energy big data are discussed.},

Both methods are widely used in the ﬁeld of forecasting and their aim on ﬁnding the most accurate approach is ever continuing. Besides the already existing single method of forecasting, the hybridization of the two forecasting methods has the potential to be applied for more accurate results. Further research works are currently ongoing, regarding the potential of hybrid method of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), or known as GLSSVM, to forecast building electrical energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Despite significant successes achieved in knowledge discovery, traditional machine learning methods may fail to obtain satisfactory performances when dealing with complex data, such as imbalanced, high-dimensional, noisy data, etc. The reason behind is that it is difficult for these methods to capture multiple characteristics and underlying structure of data. In this context, it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model. Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion, data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically, ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.},
